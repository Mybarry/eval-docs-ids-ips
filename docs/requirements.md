Here are the requirements for NSX-T Distributed IDS/IPS Proof of Value.

* vCenter Server running at least vSphere 6.7 or later
    * If your physical storage is vSAN, please ensure you've applied the following setting as mentioned [here](https://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2013/11/how-to-run-nested-esxi-on-top-of-vsan.html)
* Resource Requirements
    * Compute
        * Single Physical host running at least vSphere 6.7 or later
        * Ability to provision VMs with up to 8 vCPU
        * Ability to provision up to 64 GB of memory
    * Network
        * Single pre-configured Standard or Distributed Portgroup (Management VLAN) used to deploy all VMs In the example config, VLAN-194 is used as this isngle port-group
            * 8 x IP Addresses for VCSA, ESXi, NSX-T Manager, Edge VM Management, Edge VM Uplink and External VM
            * 4 x IP Addresses for TEP (Tunnel Endpoint) interfaces on ESXi and Edge VM
            * 1 x IP Address for T0 Static Route (optional)
            * All IP Addresses should be able to communicate with each other. These can all be in the same subnet (/27). In the example configuration provided the 10.114.209.128/27 subnet is used for all these IP addresses/interfaces: vCenter, NSX Manager Managenet Interface, T0 Router Uplink, Nested ESXi VMKernel and TEP interfaces (defined in IP pool), External VM.
