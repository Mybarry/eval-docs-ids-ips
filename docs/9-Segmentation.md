## 9. Segmenation
**Estimated Time to Complete: 30 minutes**

In this final exercise, we will leverage the **Distributed Firewall** in order to limit the attack surface. 
First, we will apply a **Macro-segmentation** policy which will isolate our **Production** environment and the applications deployed in it from the **Development** environment. 
Then, we will implement a **Micro-segmentation** policy, which will employ an **allow-list** to only allow the flows required for our applications to function and block everything else.

**Macro-Segmentation: Isolating the Production and Development enviornments**

The goal of this exercise is to completley isolate workloads deployed in **Production** from workloads deployed in **Development**. All nested workloads were previously tagged to identify which of these environments they were deployed in, and earlier in this lab, you created groups for **Production Applications** and **Development Applications** respecively. In the next few steps, you will create the appropriate firewall rules to achieve this, and then run through the **lateral movement** attack scenario again to see how lateral movement has now been limited to a particular environment.

***Create a Distributed Firewall Environment Category Policy***
1. In the NSX Manager UI, navigate to Security -->  Distributed Firewall
2. Click on the **Environments(0)** Category tab.
3. Click **ADD POLICY**
4. Click **New Policy** and change the name of the policy to **Environment Isolation**
5. Check the checkbox next to the **Environment Isolation** Policy
6. Click **ADD RULE** twice, and configure the cnew new rules as per below setps
7. Rule 1
    * Name: **Isolate Production-Development**
    * Source: **Production Applications** 
    * Destination: **Development Applications** 
    * Services: **ANY** 
    * Profiles: **NONE** 
    * Applied To: **Production Applications** , **Development Applications** 
    * Action: **Drop**
8. Rule 2
    * Name: **Isolate Development-Production**
    * Source: **Development Applications** 
    * Destination: **Production Applications**  
    * Services: **ANY** 
    * Profiles: **NONE** 
    * Applied To: **Production Applications** , **Development Applications** 
    * Action: **Drop**
9. Click **Publish** to publish these rules to the **Distributed Firewall**.
