## Description

This script makes it very easy for anyone to deploy a nested vSphere vSphere lab environment for learning and educational purposes. All required VMware components (ESXi, vCenter Server, NSX Unified Appliance and Edge) are automatically deployed, attacker and multiple victim workloads are deplyed, and NSX-T networking configuration is applied in order to anyone to start testing the NSX Distributed IDS/IPS as soon as the deploment is completed. 


Below is a diagram of what is deployed as part of the solution and you simply need to have an existing vSphere environment running that is managed by vCenter Server and with enough resources (CPU, Memory and Storage) to deploy this "Nested" lab

## FAQ

## Configuration

Before you can run the script, you will need to edit the script and update a number of variables to match your deployment environment. Details on each section is described below including actual values used in my home lab environment.

This section describes the credentials to your physical vCenter Server in which the nestedc lab environment will be deployed to:
```console
$VIServer = "mgmt-vcsa-01.cpbu.corp"
$VIUsername = "administrator@vsphere.local"
$VIPassword = "VMware1!"
```


This section describes the location of the files required for deployment.

```console
$NestedESXiApplianceOVA = "C:\Users\william\Desktop\Project-Pacific\Nested_ESXi7.0_Appliance_Template_v1.ova"
$VCSAInstallerPath = "C:\Users\william\Desktop\Project-Pacific\VMware-VCSA-all-7.0.0-15952498"
$NSXTManagerOVA = "C:\Users\william\Desktop\Project-Pacific\nsx-unified-appliance-3.0.0.0.0.15946738.ova"
$NSXTEdgeOVA = "C:\Users\william\Desktop\Project-Pacific\nsx-edge-3.0.0.0.0.15946738.ova"
```
**Note:** The path to the VCSA Installer must be the extracted contents of the ISO


This section defines the number of Nested ESXi VMs to deploy along with their associated IP Address(s). The names are merely the display name of the VMs when deployed. At a minimum, you should deploy at least three hosts, but you can always add additional hosts and the script will automatically take care of provisioning them correctly.
```console
$NestedESXiHostnameToIPs = @{
    "pacific-esxi-7" = "172.17.31.113"
    "pacific-esxi-8" = "172.17.31.114"
    "pacific-esxi-9" = "172.17.31.115"
}
```

This section describes the resources allocated to each of the Nested ESXi VM(s). Depending on your usage, you may need to increase the resources. For Memory and Disk configuration, the unit is in GB.
```console
$NestedESXivCPU = "4"
$NestedESXivMEM = "24" #GB
$NestedESXiCachingvDisk = "8" #GB
$NestedESXiCapacityvDisk = "100" #GB
```

This section describes the VCSA deployment configuration such as the VCSA deployment size, Networking & SSO configurations. If you have ever used the VCSA CLI Installer, these options should look familiar.
```console
$VCSADeploymentSize = "tiny"
$VCSADisplayName = "pacific-vcsa-3"
$VCSAIPAddress = "172.17.31.112"
$VCSAHostname = "pacific-vcsa-3.cpbu.corp" #Change to IP if you don't have valid DNS
$VCSAPrefix = "24"
$VCSASSODomainName = "vsphere.local"
$VCSASSOPassword = "VMware1!"
$VCSARootPassword = "VMware1!"
$VCSASSHEnable = "true"
```

This section describes the location as well as the generic networking settings applied to Nested ESXi VCSA & NSX VMs
```console
$VMDatacenter = "San Jose"
$VMCluster = "Cluster-01"
$VMNetwork = "SJC-CORP-MGMT"
$VMDatastore = "vsanDatastore"
$VMNetmask = "255.255.255.0"

$VMNTP = "pool.ntp.org"
$VMPassword = "VMware1!"
$VMDomain = "cpbu.corp"
$VMSyslog = "172.17.31.112"
$VMFolder = "Project-Pacific"
# Applicable to Nested ESXi only
$VMSSH = "true"
$VMVMFS = "false"
```

This section describes the configuration of the new vCenter Server from the deployed VCSA. **Default values are sufficient.**
```console
$NewVCDatacenterName = "Pacific-Datacenter"
$NewVCVSANClusterName = "Workload-Cluster"
$NewVCVDSName = "Pacific-VDS"
$NewVCDVPGName = "DVPG-Management Network"
```

This section describes the Project Pacific Configurations. **Default values are sufficient.**
```console

$StoragePolicyName = "pacific-gold-storage-policy"
$StoragePolicyTagCategory = "pacific-demo-tag-category"
$StoragePolicyTagName = "pacific-demo-storage"
$DevOpsUsername = "devops"
$DevOpsPassword = "VMware1!"
```

This section describes the NSX-T configurations, the defaults values are sufficient with for the following variables which ust be defined by users and the rest can be left as defaults.
    **$NSXLicenseKey**, **$NSXVTEPNetwork**, **$T0GatewayInterfaceAddress**, **$T0GatewayInterfaceStaticRouteAddress** and the **NSX-T Manager** and **Edge** Sections

Once you have saved your changes, you can now run the PowerCLI script as you normally would.

## Logging

There is additional verbose logging that outputs as a log file in your current working directory **pacific-nsxt-external-vghetto-lab-deployment.log**

## Sample Execution

In this example below, I will be using a single /24 native VLAN (172.17.31.0/24) which all the VMs provisioned by the automation script will be connected to. It is expected that you will have a similar configuration which is the most basic configuration for POC and testing purposes.

| Hostname                   | IP Address                     | Function                     |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| pacific-vcsa-3.cpbu.corp   | 172.17.31.112                  | vCenter Server               |
| pacific-esxi-7.cpbu.corp   | 172.17.31.113                  | ESXi                         |
| pacific-esxi-8.cpbu.corp   | 172.17.31.114                  | ESXi                         |
| pacific-esxi-9.cpbu.corp   | 172.17.31.115                  | ESXi                         |
| pacific-nsx-edge.cpbu.corp | 172.17.31.116                  | NSX-T Edge                   |
| pacific-nsx-ua.cpbu.corp   | 172.17.31.118                  | NSX-T Unified Appliance      |
| n/a                        | 172.17.31.119                  | T0 Static Route Address      |
| n/a                        | 172.17.31.120 to 172.17.31.125 | K8s Master Control Plane VMs |
| n/a                        | 172.17.31.140/27               | Ingress CIDR Range           |
| n/a                        | 172.17.31.160/27               | Egress CIDR Range            |

**Note:** Make sure Ingress/Egress CIDR ranges do NOT overlap and the IP Addresses within that block is not being used. This is important as the Egress CIDR will consume at least 15 IP Addresses for the SNAT of each namespace within the Supervisor Cluster.

### Lab Deployment Script

Here is a screenshot of running the script if all basic pre-reqs have been  met and the confirmation message before starting the deployment:

Here is an example output of a complete deployment:

**Note:** Deployment time will vary based on underlying physical infrastructure resources. In my lab, this took ~40min to complete.
